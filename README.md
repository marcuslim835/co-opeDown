### 5.2 Features
Feature | Description
------------ | -------------
Level Based Design | Provide a solid framework for the development of tasks that are increasing in difficulty. When contrasted to the difficulty levels, the step up in difficulty would be smaller. For example, higher levels of the same difficulty level would involve bigger numbers, but with the same nature of operations (eg. addition questions). Refer to the developer guide section 1.4 for a detailed explanation or the diagram below for a brief explanation.
Co-op | For two different people to work together to solve questions.
Infinite Replayability | Randomly generated questions to ensure every experience is an unique experience.
One-handed Controls | Set to four keys per controlled character to allow two players to use a single keyboard to play the game (and even for one person to use both his hands to control both characters!).
Save/Load System | Enables players to pick up and put down the game whenever they want to without losing progress.
Different Game Difficulties | Differing sets of problems for different age groups. For example, easier game difficulty levels can be math problems dealing with addition. A higher game difficulty level would include multiplication and even polynomials.
2 Game Modes | Classic mode for an all-round experience, Endless mode for those dedicated to only solving math problems.
