## 2 Motivation

With the resurgence of Covid-19, many people find themselves stuck at home with their family members and want to take the opportunity to engage with their family to strengthen bonds and interactions from the safety of their own homes. Many popular computer-based multiplayer games currently out in the market are non family-friendly. We hope to build a game that is suitable for all ages in a family setting for all to participate in as the game requires teamwork and multitasking. This is a more beneficial use of time as it provides people a platform to bond and interact. 

The 2D platformer game is set in a dreamed up world where a pair of chickens are the protagonists of the story. In our game, we dive deeper into the dreamscapes by solving the problems that are located on each level/stage. Join the chickens in their quest to travel round the world while vaccinating the bats!

## 3 Aim
We hope to make a co-op game suitable for most ages to play when they feel bored, while engaging in some intellectual and bonding activities.

### 5.2 Features
Feature | Description
------------ | -------------
Level Based Design | Provide a solid framework for the development of tasks that are increasing in difficulty. When contrasted to the difficulty levels, the step up in difficulty would be smaller. For example, higher levels of the same difficulty level would involve bigger numbers, but with the same nature of operations (eg. addition questions). Refer to the developer guide section 1.4 for a detailed explanation or the diagram below for a brief explanation.
Co-op | For two different people to work together to solve questions.
Infinite Replayability | Randomly generated questions to ensure every experience is an unique experience.
One-handed Controls | Set to four keys per controlled character to allow two players to use a single keyboard to play the game (and even for one person to use both his hands to control both characters!).
Save/Load System | Enables players to pick up and put down the game whenever they want to without losing progress.
Different Game Difficulties | Differing sets of problems for different age groups. For example, easier game difficulty levels can be math problems dealing with addition. A higher game difficulty level would include multiplication and even polynomials.
2 Game Modes | Classic mode for an all-round experience, Endless mode for those dedicated to only solving math problems.

Note 1: Work from Home sessions are usually followed by an online team meeting to update project logs and set the agenda for the next few days of working from home, but are excluded from the computation of total hours for simplicity.

Note 2: Part of the project documentation (such as project logs) was done as the templates/code was written. As such, the time spent on project documentation during the coding process has been included with the Work from Home sessions.

Note 3: Progress on the project in the period between 13/7/2021 and 16/7/2021 was halted due to NS ICT commitments by both orbitees.

## 7 Responses on Milestone Feedback
We value all the evaluations that we get from the feedback exercises and hence we will endeavour to provide a response as to how we can work together to produce a better final product.

### 7.1 Milestone 1
| Suggestion | Response |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Point 1 (Level based design) and point 3 (Differing difficult levels) seem to overlap, please clarify in your readme. | TBC |
| Since this is a family game as well, the game can be made such that more than 2 players can play it together at the same time as well, hence solving the problem that you mentioned. | TBC |
| More details on the tech stack can be shown to let use know what is going on behind the scenes. The flowchart does not really show how the different level of difficulty is going to be implemented and the infinite replayability feature. More details on these would be great! Poster can be better done with the features shown being more prominent. | TBC |
| The poster could have included the features more clearly with details. As of now, I am unable to obtain much information from the poster without reading the README. | TBC |
| I feel that these features right now are pretty easy to implement (aside from local multiplayer if you do something like LAN) so I do believe if you are aiming for Apollo 11 you can look into including a storyline and maybe add a social aspect to the game to compare scores with others from an online leaderboard! | TBC |
| However, one thing I can add is to playtest alot and early into the beginning phase. For any game, you need to have constant feedback and playtesting would accomplish just that. | TBC |
| Infinite replayability with randomly generated questions: If these questions are randomly generated, how many questions do the group intend to make? The amount of work needed seems to be never-ending and countless. Perhaps refining this would be a bit more plausible. | TBC |
| Bugs for current build: Sometimes just being in the vicinity of the number platforms without standing on them will already trigger the game to end. Can be solved by moving the Box Collider 2D components so no problem. You may want to take a look at the OnCollisionStay2D function vs OnCollisionEnter2D function if you are using Unity version 2020. | WIP |
| Since Unity does not have a global variable system (scenes are discrete) here's a script that allows you to transfer objects that you want to be constantly running between scenes. I used it for a continuous music player in my game. >Script skipped to save space | WIP |
